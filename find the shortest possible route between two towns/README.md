This project implements a solution to a very common issue: how to get from one point to another using the shortest route using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
 Note: the two input points are in a graph, representing cities and towns.  
 
The program allows the user to enter the input file containing information of roads connecting cities/towns. 
 And then constructs a graph based on the information provided from the file.
 After that, it allows the user to enter pairs of cities/towns and the algorithm computes the shortest path between the two cities/towns entered.
 
************************************************************************
The file contains a list of cities/towns with the following data/format:

Field 1: Vertex ID of the 1st end of the segment 

Field 2: Vertex ID of the 2nd of the segment

Field 3: Name of the town

Field 4: Distance in Kilometer
