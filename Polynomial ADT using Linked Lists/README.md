This project implements a Polynomial ADT using Linked Lists. 
 It includes the Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction operations of polynomials.
 
Such that, the program reads a file of polynomials called equations.txt and stores each equation in a doubly-linked list.
 Once the file is read and equations are loaded into the linked lists, the user can perform mathematical operations on the polynomials 
 (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) by selecting an operation from a menu.
  The user can also choose to store the results of all operations in a file called results.txt.
